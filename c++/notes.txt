1)Dynamic declaration --->

    if you have to declare a variable and use it inside loops , then instead of declaring it before
    int main(), you can declare it directly inside loop . By this you can use your memory space 
    effectively . After comming outside loop , the variable declared will be deleted and hence you can 
    use that space to store something else.

    Declare only that variables outside that are needed throughout execution. Improve code quality.
